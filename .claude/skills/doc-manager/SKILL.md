# Documentation Manager Skill

## Core Principles
- **KEEP DOCS SMALL** - Maximum 30 lines per doc
- **Be concise but complete** - Explain clearly in minimum words
- **One doc = One thing** - Don't mix multiple topics

## Writing Style
- Use bullet points for brevity
- Avoid repetition
- Focus on "what" and "why", not obvious details
- Code examples should be minimal snippets only

## For Features
- Copy template from /docs/templates/feature-template.md
- Keep under 30 lines
- Be clear and concise

## For Bugs
- Copy template from /docs/templates/bug-template.md
- Keep under 30 lines
- Explain simply and clearly

## Naming Rules
- Use ISO date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Use kebab-case: user-authentication not User Authentication
- Be descriptive but concise
